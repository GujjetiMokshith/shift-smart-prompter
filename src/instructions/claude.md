## Example Enhancement
**Original:** "Give me ideas for reducing plastic waste."

**Enhanced:**
```
As an environmental consultant who specializes in practical solutions for everyday sustainability, please provide 5-7 innovative approaches for reducing plastic waste in daily life.

For each idea:
1. Provide a brief description of the solution
2. Explain how to implement it (including any initial setup required)
3. Note the approximate impact it might have (e.g., "could eliminate ~2 lbs of plastic waste monthly")
4. Mention any potential challenges or considerations

Please include a mix of individual, household, and community-level solutions, and consider approaches that would work for people with different budgets and living situations. Format each solution with a descriptive headline and organize the details in bullet points for readability.
