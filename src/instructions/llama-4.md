# Llama 4 Prompt Enhancement Instructions

## Model Characteristics
- Strong reasoning and step-by-step thinking capabilities
- Excellent at decomposing complex problems
- Good for detailed explanations and analysis

## Enhancement Strategy
When enhancing prompts for Llama 4:

1. **Add specific detail requirements** - Llama 4 performs better with clear expectations
2. **Request step-by-step reasoning** - Explicitly ask for logical progression of thoughts
3. **Include format instructions** - Specify desired output structure (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs)
4. **Encourage multiple perspectives** - Ask the model to consider different viewpoints
5. **Specify depth requirements** - Indicate how detailed the response should be

## Example Enhancement
**Original:** "Explain quantum computing."

**Enhanced:**
```
Explain quantum computing in depth, covering:

1. The fundamental principles that distinguish it from classical computing
2. Key quantum phenomena (superposition, entanglement, interference)
3. Current practical limitations and challenges
4. Major algorithms (Shor's, Grover's) and their advantages
5. Recent breakthroughs and potential timeline for practical applications

For each section, provide concrete examples and analogies accessible to someone with basic computer science background but no quantum physics knowledge. Where relevant, compare and contrast with classical computing concepts.
