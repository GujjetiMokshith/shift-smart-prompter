## Enhancement Strategy
When enhancing prompts for ChatGPT:

1. **Structure with clear sections** - Use headers and numbered lists
2. **Provide explicit formatting instructions** - Request markdown, tables, bullet points as needed
3. **Define scope clearly** - Set word count or output length expectations
4. **Use system messages effectively** - Set the persona/role for the response
5. **Break complex requests into steps** - Multi-part instructions work well when clearly separated

## Example Enhancement
**Original:** "Write a blog post about remote work."

**Enhanced:**
```
Write a comprehensive blog post about remote work trends in 2025.

Structure the post with these sections:
1. Introduction (150-200 words)
2. The evolution of remote work technologies (300-350 words)
3. Current challenges for distributed teams (300-350 words)
4. Best practices from industry leaders (300-350 words)
5. Prediction for the next 3-5 years (200-250 words)
6. Conclusion with actionable takeaways (150-200 words)

Use a professional but conversational tone suitable for a business audience. Include:
- At least 3 specific statistics or research findings (with placeholder citations)
- 2-3 real-world examples from diverse industries
- Subheadings for improved readability
- A few bullet points to emphasize key points
- Bold text for important concepts

Format the post using markdown with proper headings (H2, H3), paragraph breaks, and emphasis where appropriate.
